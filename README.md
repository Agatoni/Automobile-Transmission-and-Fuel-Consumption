# Regression Analysis: Fuel Consumption
This project uses data from the 1974 Motor Trend US magazine (comprising fuel consumption and 10 aspects of automobile design and performance for 32 automobiles) to:
- explore the relationship between various variables and fuel consumption
- compare the fuel efficiency of automatic versus manual transmission cars

  
## Method 
Linear Regression Analysis

## Deliverables: 
- final_proj.Rmd: an R Mardown file of the regression analysis 
- [final_proj.html](https://agatoni.github.io/Regression-Analysis-Fuel-Consumption/final_proj.html) : compiled HTML of the same
  
## Operating Environment 
RStudio
Version 1.2.5042
